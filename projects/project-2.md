summary: A simple Java game of minsweeper.
---



This project consisted of creating a simple minesweeper game using Java.  Me and two other ICS 211 members did this as a final project for the class, Robert Figgs, and Weifan Liao.  This game took two months and was created using Java and its natural GUI interface.  This project was tricky because of the technical detail that was Java GUIs.  This project was difficult, but because of our very experienced team, this was a lot easier then working alone.
