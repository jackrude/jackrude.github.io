summary: My team developed a web app for finding posting clubs at UH Manoa
---

ClubHub was a group project for my ICS 314 class in the Spring of 2017.  This project consisted of three members, Aaron Villanueva, Christopher Oh, and Jacob Rude.  The basic idea of this project was to create a website where UH Manoa users can post edit and share clubs using a secure login with their UH Manoa credentials.
