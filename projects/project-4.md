ClubHub was a group project for my ICS 314 class in the Spring of 2017.  This project consisted of three members, Aaron Villanueva, Christopher Oh, and Jacob Rude.  The basic idea of this project was to create a website where UH Manoa users can post edit and share clubs using a secure login with their UH Manoa credentials.  We used Meteor as our framework for this project.  For more information on Meteor, visit the [Meteor Website](https://www.meteor.com/).

My contributins to the project were as follows.  On the first Milestone, I was given the task of making two mockup pages, the landing page and the homepage.  The landing page I decided to make it a simple design and feel.  The same was done for the homepage, the user would be able to view the clubs they were following by looking at the homepage after logging in, but since this was a mockup no functionality was given to these pages.  For the second Milestone I was told by my group members to integrate a CAS login system.  Basically any user who visited the site would need to click the login button on the top right corner of the screen, this will create a popup window for the user to login with their UH Manoa student id and password, only after authentication will the user be able to navigate past the landing page.  Also throughout the entire project I was in charge of creating and maintaining the website used for showcasing ClubHub.  I also was the one to identify and collect all of the feedback and input, both positive and negative, for ClubHub from the five students listed on the website.
