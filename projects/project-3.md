summary: Built a custom PC from parts bought online.
---

This project took about 2 weeks of planning and one day of building.  I wanted to personally challenge myself into building a computer from parts bought online.  Most of my time was spent in figuring out a few different criteria.  The first was what cpu I wanted to build around.  I ended up building around an AMD processor because of the value for the amount of CPU power it could produce.  I then bought parts that would work with the process such as the motherboard.  The second was price.  I ended up spending around $750 to build this gaming PC.  I used some basic math to curve efficiency for the dollar amount and around $750 was the most bang for the buck I could come up with at the time.  It took only a day to assemble and was a very fun challenge overall.  Planning was more tedious then the actual build process itself.
